{"name":"mbl-skunk","tagline":"","body":"# Recreating Your Lists\r\n\r\nIn our new catalogue search.virl.bc.ca you have the option of creating lists of books or other material youâ€™d like to read some day or that you especially like (or dislike). If you have these sorts of lists in our old catalogue you might want to make them accessible in the new one. Here is how to export your lists and re-create them in the new catalogue. \r\n\r\n# Exporting Lists from Bibliocommons (the old catalogue)\r\n\r\n## 1. Log into the catalogue and access your list\r\nWhen you log in to the old catalogue at virl.bibliocommons.com and click on the tab that says My VIRL, you will see the My Lists link to access your existing lists. \r\n\r\n## 2. Print off your old list\r\nWhen you have your list open there is a small print icon to the upper right of the list. Click it and your list will open in a different display. This is a better format for printing or saving.\r\n\r\n## 3. Search for the items on your old list in the new catalogue\r\nNow use the list you saved/printed off as your checklist to search for the same items in the new catalogue and add them to a list there.\r\n\r\n# Exporting Lists from Horizon Information Portal (the old traditional catalogue)\r\n\r\n## 1. Log into the catalogue and access your list\r\nWhen you log in to the old catalogue at hip.virl.bc.ca and click on the icon that says My List, you will see anyitems in your List. If this is empty, you may have to click the Manage Lists button to find your lists. \r\n\r\n## 2. Email yourself your old list\r\nWhen you have your list open there is a small link saying Email this list at the bottom left of the screen. Click it and you will be presented with two fields for the email, a subject (which can be any text you want) and a destination email address, which should be yours. You can change the format the list is sent in, but HTML, the default, should be fine. Click the Send button.\r\n\r\n## 3. Search for the items on your old list in the new catalogue\r\nNow your old list has been emailed to you. You can use that list as your checklist to search for the same items in the new catalogue and add them to a list there. \r\n\r\n# Creating a list in the new catalogue\r\n\r\n## 1. Log in and search for the titles you wish to add to your list. \r\nWhen you find a title you wish to add to a list, click the shopping cart icon (in the search results or the title's page, to add it to your cart.\r\n\r\n## 2. Move titles from your cart to your list\r\nClick on My Cart (at the top right of the page). When you see the list of titles you want to add to your list, click the Save to List button. There will be an option to save the items to an existing list (in a dropdown menu) or to a new list. Be sure to click the Add (or Create) button to finish the process.\r\n\r\n## 3. Check on your list\r\nYour lists can be found under your account when you log in. Click on your name near the top right of the page. Then click My Lists in the lefthand column.\r\n\r\n# TIPS & TRICKS\r\n\r\n1. Instead of printing on paper, keep your old lists open in a file on your computer. You can select, then copy (CTRL-C) and paste (CTRL-V) titles into the new catalogue's search bar, rather than retyping everything.\r\n2. Talk to a librarian about printing your old lists from a library computer without a fee.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
